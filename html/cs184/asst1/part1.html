    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing Lines</h2>
        <p>In Part 1, I used the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/goa/mallinnus/lines/bresenh.html">Bresenham</a> Line-Drawing Algorithm which was linked to on the website's assignment specs.  This algorithm is a way to rasterize lines while avoiding float arithmetic through the use of an iterating error variable.  After implementing the pseudocode they provided, only one octant successfully rasterized:
        </p>

            <figcaption align="middle">Part 1: First attempt to rasterize lines.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, I decided to implement a check to see if the change in y was greater than the change in x.  In this case, we simply rasterize in an identical way, with the two variables switched.  After implementing this successfully two octants rasterized properly:
        </p>
        <div align="middle">
            <img src="images/part1/test2-1.png" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Part 1: Second attempt to rasterize lines.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Next, the quadrant across from the successful one failed to rasterize because the for loop used in the pseudocode only works to continually increase x and y in the positive direction.  In order to fix this, I simply caught the cases where y1 &#60; y0 and x1 &#60; x0 and flipped the variables.  Since the slope is always increasing in these two quadrants, the lines remain invariant, because it'll always end up flipping both at once.  After finishing this fix two quadrants rasterized properly:
        </p>
        <div align="middle">
            <img src="images/part1/test2-2.png" width="400px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Part 1: Third attempt to rasterize lines.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Finally, to finish the last two quadrants, I first implemented the Bresenham Algorithm for negative slopes and added the conditional.  Then I made parallel changes to the previous ones for the cases of negative slopes to yield the final image:
        </p>
