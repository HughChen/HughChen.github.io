      <p><b>Deliverable - Explain the difference between using a pinhole camera and a fully simulated lens system. What effects can you only see when using a real lens as opposed to only a pinhole?</b></p>

      <p>Pinhole cameras are cameras that only have a pinhole separating the world and the sensor.  Lens cameras have a lens as a separating element, which is often composed of several lens elements.  Between these two there are a few effects that we only have access to when using a pinhole.  One of the effects is focus and the auxilary effects that come with it, such as the vertigo effect and perspective composition.  Pinhole cameras have very wide depths of field and aren't really capable of focusing the way that lens cameras can.  Additionally, pinhole cameras don't have apertures that they can modulate in order to change the exposure.  As such, effects relating to depth of field and motion blur are harder to achieve.</p>

      <p><b>Deliverable - Show screenshots of the lenstester app showing ray bundles converging at the a conjugate point for each of the four lenses.</b></p>

      <p><b>Deliverable - Use your focus_depth function to get the world-side conjugates for 100 evenly spaced sensor depths ranging from close focus to infinity. Plot sensor depth vs. conjugate to show the approximate inverse relationship.</b></p>

      <p><b>Deliverable - Use the ; and ' keys to get one of the scenes as close to manually focused as you can and save a screenshot at high rendering quality (1024spp, 1splight, 100bounce). Make sure to use a dramatic angle that highlights the defocus blur from using a real lens and maybe also the perspective effects you can achieve.</b></p>

      <p>The defocus blur is clear on the tail, although not quite to the degree there was in the writeup.  Perhaps they used a different lens.</p>
